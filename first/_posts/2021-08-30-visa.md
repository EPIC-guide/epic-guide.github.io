## B Permit (Permis B)
Unless you have Swiss nationality, or have lived for a long time in Switzerland, you will be in Switzerland legally on a B permit. Your residence will be in Switzerland.

## Registering with the city (Contrôle des Habitants).
It is important to note that you need to get your permit at the city office where you live. E.g., living in the town of Ecublens, you cannot get a permit from the Lausanne office.

## Non-EU
* You will need to go to the embassy and most likely you will get a temporary visa for a few months.
* As soon as you arrive, you will have to register at the commune and you will get the residence permit which you will have to renew every year (and pay the 100 CHF fee)

## EU (European Union)
* With EPFL’s employment contract, the government gives EU/EFTA nationals a residence permit, valid for five years. The only exceptions are for Croatian nationals (see [government source](https://www.sem.admin.ch/sem/en/home/themen/aufenthalt/eu_efta/ausweis_b_eu_efta.html)).
* Some people may also get a 1 year B visa as the first year EDIC contract is given for one year
