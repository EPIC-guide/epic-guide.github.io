Given Lausanne's location in Europe, you can also visit all kinds of museums easily, such as the French National Museum of Modern Art in Paris.


### Cultural Events
There are plenty of festivals and other events taking place around Lausanne and Switzerland in general. Here are two links through which you can find out about upcoming events:

EPFL also has partnerships with cultural institutions, and offers free tickets for cultural events offered by these institutions. Details on these:

* The website [offres-culturelles.epfl.ch](http://offres-culturelles.epfl.ch/) is accessible to anyone.
* Competitions are only for EPFL students and staff members and accessible via an Intranet login.
* Competitions are open for 24 to 48 hours and there is a draw among all participants for the winners. As soon as the competition closes, the winners are notified by e-mail.
* The winners are required to honour their commitment by actually attending the event for which they have won tickets. In case of last-minute problems, they are required to excuse themselves by notifying the theatre as well as the EPFL Cultural & Art Affairs. Persons failing to comply with these instructions may have their entries withdrawn from future competitions.
