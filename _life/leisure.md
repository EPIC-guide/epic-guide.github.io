## Vacation

As an EPFL PhD student, you are entitled to 25 days of vacation, i.e., 5 weeks, per year.
If you do not take all of the days, they roll over to the next year, but HR will be on your back and may eventually force you to take them for your own well-being.

In general, you can take vacation whenever you want as long as your advisor agrees and, during a semester, the lecturer you are TAing for agrees.
The latter may ask you to find someone to replace you as TA.

If you are absent for medical reasons, you need a doctor's note after 3 consecutive days.


## EPFL associations

There are many associations at EPFL that focus on leisure activities, such as specific games, cultures, or events.

In particular, PolyDoc is the association for all PhD students, who will regularly send you emails about their events such as apéros,
and EPIC is the IC PhD students' association, who will do the same for IC-only events such as board game nights.

One unique association is Satellite, a.k.a., "Sat", the EPFL bar. It is entirely run by student volunteers and organizes various activities, such as concerts,
coffee-theater sessions (café théatre), board/card games nights (soirées ludiques), or jam sessions.
The calendar of events organized by Sat can be found directly on their [webpage](https://satellite.bar/).
The list of upcoming concerts can be found [here](https://satellite.bar/concerts/).
