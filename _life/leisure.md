## EPFL associations

There are many associations at EPFL that focus on leisure activities, such as specific games, cultures, or events.

In particular, PolyDoc is the association for all PhD students, who will regularly send you emails about their events such as apéros,
and EPIC is the IC PhD students' association, who will do the same for IC-only events such as board game nights.

One unique association is Satellite, a.k.a., "Sat", the EPFL bar. It is entirely run by student volunteers and organizes various activities, such as concerts,
coffee-theater sessions (café théatre), board/card games nights (soirées ludiques), or jam sessions.
The calendar of events organized by Sat can be found directly on their [webpage](https://satellite.bar/).
The list of upcoming concerts can be found [here](https://satellite.bar/concerts/).
