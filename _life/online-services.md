There are many websites, apps, and tools that can make your life easier; here is a selection.


## Swiss Post

If you register an account on [the Swiss Post website](https://www.post.ch/en), you can confirm your address by receiving a letter with a code you will input online.
After that, you will be notified of all parcels and letters with signature as they are sent to you, with tracking and services such as delaying reception.

The [PostCard Creator](https://www.post.ch/en/sending-letters/sending-letters/postcard-creator-app)
lets you send one postcard for free every day. There's a small advertisement at the back. You can even send the postcard to yourself as a free way to print photos.


## News

If you want to keep up with what's going in Switzerland,
[swissinfo](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng) provides news in ten languages including English so that you don't have to wait to be fluent in one of the Swiss languages to learn what's going on.


## Maps and weather

If you want to enjoy the outdoors like a large part of the Swiss population does,
[SwissTopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/maps-data-online/maps-geodata-online/swisstopo-app.html) is a free app provided by the Swiss government with high quality maps of even the most remote places in Switzerland.

Combined with the highly accurate forecasts provided [SwissMeteo](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=overview), you're ready to get out there and enjoy Switzerland!


## Communication

Join the [EPFL IC PhDs Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/epfl-phd/shared_invite/zt-3c4lta837-tW7NVg0otxBgF5yBfBjgPw) to ask any question, organize events, keep up to date with EPIC, and so on if you haven't already!

There is also an [official EPFL IC Slack](https://epfl-ic.slack.com) which is more work-focused, you can use it to create a project channel to collaborate on a semester project.

Signing in with your EPFL account via SSO on [Zoom](https://zoom.epfl.ch/) gives you access to the paid features.


## Writing

To write papers, your thesis, or even your personal documents, there are plenty of useful tools.
Software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Adobe Create Cloud, and so on can be obtained at EPFL from [Distrilog](https://distrilog.epfl.ch/).
Check with your lab in general, as EPFL has licenses for some online services and your lab may also have licenses for others.

Using Git with [GitHub](https://github.com) is good for version control; EPFL also has [a hosted GitLab instance](https://gitlab.epfl.ch).

To design pictures, you can use PowerPoint, Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, geogebra, tikz...

To write, beyond MS Word there is LaTeX which comes in many distributions, including [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) which is convenient to work with multiple authors.

To manage your bibliography, [Zotero](https://zotero.org) is a good solution.

To manage your notes, you could use [notion](https://www.notion.so/) or [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).


## Politics

If you want to get stuck into the details of Swiss politics, [VoteInfo](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/abstimmungen/voteinfo.html)
is a fascinating app that informs Swiss voters about the texts of upcoming referendums. It's a great way to discover what interesting societal questions Switzerland is currently debating about.
