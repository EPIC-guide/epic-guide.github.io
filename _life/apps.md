## Travel by train:
* [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/de/home.html)
  - Check SuperSaver tickets if you can commit to a specific train a few days in advance.
  - Consider using the EasyRide feature (swipe in when getting onboard, swipe out when leaving). The best combination of tickets will be chosen automatically over the entire day, so it’s possible to get significant price reductions (e.g. for certain round-trips).
* [Fairtiq](https://fairtiq.com/en-ch/)
  - Same as SBB’s EasyRide feature
  - Has a 5% credit if you use it more than 5 days in a month.

## Mobile banking
* [TWINT](https://www.twint.ch/en/)
  - TWINT is a nice payment alternative to cash accepted by online shops, supermarkets, and also many small enterprises like local farms for whom card payment fees are too high

## PubliBike

## Shopping discounts
* Migros
  - [Cumulus](https://www.migros.ch/fr/cumulus.html)
* Coop’s Supercard app
  - Don’t forget to sign in for the “hello family” club as well, it massively increases the amount and quality of the vouchers you get
* [TooGoodToGo](https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us)
  - Save food - Help the Planet

## [PostCard Creator](https://www.post.ch/en/sending-letters/sending-letters/postcard-creator-app) 
Send 1 postcard for free every day. There’s a small advertisement at the back. Can send the postcard to yourself as a free way to print photos.

## [EchoSOS](https://echosos.com/en/emergency-app/)
"Be prepared in an emergency with EchoSOS"
