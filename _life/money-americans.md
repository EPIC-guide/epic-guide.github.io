the world. Finances are no exception.

financial purposes. While I have tried my best to research the information below, I
do not guarantee that any of it is accurate. Do not consider this page official
financial advice. If you need tax or financial advice, particularly if your finances
are anything beyond dead simple, consult a professional financial advisor well-versed

## Who is financially a "US person"?

The exact answer depends on which agency and regulation you're asking about. But
generally, all US citizens irrespective of residence are US persons; anyone who the
IRS considers a resident in a given year due to substantial physical presence in the
US (that phrase has a technical meaning) is a US person; anyone who, even if not
physically present in the US, would for other reasons be considered a US tax
resident, such as lawful permanent residents (a.k.a. green card holders) or
the spouses of US tax residents under certain conditions, is a US person; and some
other people are US persons for reasons that I've given up on trying to precisely
understand, such as connections to US territories.

The common case: if you're reading this, you're probably moving to EPFL from the US
in the middle of a financial year, which makes you a US person for at least that
year. If you're a US citizen or green card holder, you will be a US person in the
following years too.

The second common case: you are a US person in the past financial year because you
did an internship in the US, but you have no other ties to the US. In that case, only
[§ US taxes for nonresident aliens](#us-taxes-for-nonresident-aliens)
is relevant to you.


# The TL;DR: practical information

## Banking

Although there was some turmoil with US persons' accounts at Swiss financial
institutions in the previous decade, many institutions are now taking US persons as
clients with some extra paperwork. They differ in how much complexity they are
willing to handle and able to give you good advice about (e.g., tax obligations on
shares of EU companies held in your Swiss brokerage account). For banking in
particular (as opposed to other financial services that I don't know much about), the
large, international banks, like UBS and Credit Suisse, are generally better at this
than the smaller, local ones.

Note that Swiss bank accounts typically have monthly maintenance fees that they are
less likely to waive for you than in the US (where waivers for being a student, having
a minimum daily balance, etc. are common).
But it doesn't hurt to ask for a waiver when opening your account.

Note that you may have to report the balance of this account when filing your US
federal taxes. See [§ US federal taxes](#us-federal-taxes).

_Personal note from Shardul:_ I personally have had a good experience with UBS. I had
to make an appointment with presumably their 'special' banker at their main branch in
Lausanne (Place Saint-François). It took around 40 minutes, and they gave me free
coffee, and I had a chance to sit down with the banker and ask questions 1-on-1.
Beyond their usual account-opening forms, I had to fill out a W-9 (which is standard
for many US accounts, and has the sole purpose of collecting your SSN/TIN) and a
waiver of my privacy rights so that they can share information about my accounts with
the IRS. The banker actually apologized for it.

## Credit cards

Due to various financial regulations, credit cards in Switzerland (and the EU) do not
offer users much in the way of rewards or cashback like US credit cards do, and
you will consequently notice much less marketing and usage of credit cards.[^1]
Getting a credit card in Switzerland is hardly worth the effort—if they are
even willing to give you one. The basic, no-fee, 0.2% cashback card that UBS offers
to existing customers is granted if the customer either:

 * demonstrates an employment contact valid for at least two years, which an EPFL PhD
   student cannot do, because our contracts are renewed yearly; or
 * makes a 'locked' deposit equal to the credit limit on the card that can be
   withdrawn only when the card is closed. (What's the point, then?)

However, if you have a US-issued credit card with no foreign transaction fees but
good rewards and some amount of liquid money in the US that you want to transfer to
Switzerland anyway, then it's a great idea to use that card (and pay it off with said
liquid money) for everyday purchases in Switzerland. You're essentially earning
US-level cashback on the USD-CHF transfer which you would otherwise have to pay a
financial institution for, and credit cards usually have better exchange rates than
banks. But the card issuer and network aren't making much money from fees nor
advertizing revenue off of you. So you're
eating into the profits of Big Banking! Go you! At least until they close your card
because they notice you've permanently moved out of the country.

_Personal note from Shardul:_ I actually did the above with a Wells Fargo Autograph
card, which is a Visa Signature card that gives 1% cashback on all purchases, plus 2%
on travel, dining, and streaming subscriptions, plus $200 if you spend $1,000 in the
first 3 months, which I did by booking my tickets to Switzerland and buying a bike
after I got here. They haven't closed it yet!

## Investing in Switzerland

_(This section applies only to US citizens and tax residents.)_

Don't. Invest in the US instead. See [§ Swiss taxes](#swiss-taxes) for how to
report your investments. Note that you ordinarily have to be in the US to open a US
investment account but then leaving afterwards is no problem.

### Pillar 3a retirement savings

Don't. Invest in an IRA in the US instead. Pillar 3a (and Pillar 2) has
interactions with both US and Swiss taxes, so see [§ Taxes](#taxes) for more.

## Taxes

I used to tell a joke about enjoying doing my taxes as if it was an elaborate board
game but I recently found out that [xkcd stole it](https://xkcd.com/1566/).

### US federal taxes

The US imposes tax obligations on US persons on their income from anywhere in the
world, regardless of their residence. The US also imposes social security
contribution obligations. Isn't that just lovely? Isn't America just such a unique
country?

However, the US in its infinite benevolence provides you relief from these
obligations in several ways:

 * You can take a foreign tax credit for foreign tax you have already paid, or you
   can deduct certain foreign earned income from your taxable income. (You may still
   owe the US some taxes after these reductions.)
 * Due to US-Swiss tax treaties, typically only one of the two countries can tax you
   on interest, dividends, pensions, estates, etc. Figuring out which country(s) for
   which types of income at which rates is best left to a professional.
 * Due to US-Swiss totalization agreements, typically you are only obligated to
   contribute to social security in one of the two countries. Swiss Pillar 1 is
   seen as equivalent to Social Security, but Swiss Pillar 2 has no privileged
   status. See [§ Pillar 2](#pillar-2) below.

The US imposes two additional reporting requirements for foreign assets. One comes
from the IRS and is called Form 8938. If you are living in Switzerland on a PhD
student's salary then you will probably be below the minimum amount of assets that
would require you to file this, but it is worth checking anyway. The other comes from
FinCEN (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—a rather scary name) and is
called the FBAR. There is a good chance you will have to file this one. Penalties for
not filing these when you are required to, or providing incorrect information, are
quite severe, especially from FinCEN. (I imagine their agents must be chasing mafiosi
during the week, and relaxing on the weekends by investigating PhD students abroad…)
Luckily, the official IRS documentation for these requirements is helpful and not too
difficult to follow.

The IRS also benevolently grants you an automatic two-month extension to file your
returns because you are incurring the hardship of living abroad, so until June 15 (or
the closest following business day) in normal cases. (All US taxpayers regardless of
residence can request an automatic six-month extension with Form 4868.) Remember that
the IRS will charge interest on underpaid taxes starting from the regular deadline.

#### Pillar 2

For US tax purposes, your contributions to Swiss Pillar 2 are not deductible
from your income, because the US does not recognize this as anything other than
ownership interest in a foreign fund. In fact, your employer's contributions[^8] to
Pillar 2 are considered part of your wages and should be reported as such. The
eventual distribution from Pillar 2 will be tax-exempt in the US when it is
taxed in Switzerland if I am reading the US-Swiss tax treaty correctly. You need to
report the total value of your Pillar 2 with your foreign assets.

### US state taxes

Don't forget to file a part-year resident state tax return for the year in which you
leave the US. State taxes are typically friendlier than federal taxes and will only
tax your income sourced from that state, but may not necessarily honor federal tax
treaties and totalization agreements, if the situation ever arises.

### US taxes for nonresident aliens

If you are not a US citizen ("alien") and not a US tax resident ("nonresident", which
does not mean the same thing as in plain English), the following is true:

 * You have to file US federal and state tax returns for only that year. The federal
   return form will likely be 1040-NR.
 * You will end up paying some US federal and state income tax. You will probably get
   a refund out of the taxes originally deducted at source.
 * You will not pay Swiss income tax on the same income, but it will count towards
   determining your tax rate. It should be reported under "_Revenus d'activités
   lucratives et rentes imposables dans un autre État_" ("Income from gainful
   activities and pensions taxable in another state").
 * You are not exempt from Social Security contributions if you were on an H1-B visa,
   but you are exempt / should be able to get them back if you were on an F-1 or J-1
   visa. Ideally they should not have been deducted to begin with.
 * The foreign asset reporting requirements described above don't apply to you.

If you are being considered a US tax resident but are on a student visa and want to
claim you are a nonresident, file Form 8843.

### Swiss taxes

The [Money](money) page covers the basics. In particular, without a Pillar 3a,
the tax deducted at source (_l'impôt à la source_) in a regular year is probably less
than what you would have to pay if you filled out the _Taxation ordinaire ultérieure_
(TOU) form, so requesting a TOU if you don't have to is not worth it. In the year
that you move to Switzerland and hence have Swiss income for only part of the year,
you may think that your total income falls below the minimum[^2] for taxation and you
could get a tax refund by filing a TOU. Although this is true, note that a TOU election cannot be
undone, and you will end up paying more tax in following years as mentioned before.
However, if you will be _required_ to file a TOU in following years anyway (see next
paragraph), it may be worth it to get the first year's taxes back.

Note that you are _required_ to file a TOU under certain circumstances, one of which
is if you have any income not subject to source withholding, such as investment
returns. This TOU is not "sticky" like the elective TOU. Then there are two or maybe
three relevant annexes to the standard tax return:

 1. Annex 1, _État des titres et autres placements de capitaux_, or Statement of
    securities and other capital investments. Most of it will be blank except for the
    number(s) copied over from the annex(es) below. (Except if you have Swiss
    investments, of course, which you shouldn't.)

 1. Annex DA-1, _Demande d'imputation d'impôts étrangers prélevés à la source pour
    dividendes et intérêts étrangers échus en 20XX_, or Request for imputation of
    foreign taxes already levied at the source on foreign dividends and interest
    issued in 20XX (replace with actual year). Here I believe you can report any US taxes withheld on your
    investments in the US. If the tax administration accepts this, then they will
    refund you that amount from the Swiss taxes you paid/will pay on the same income
    to avoid double taxation. The income will still count towards your total income
    for the purposes of determining tax _rates_.

	What I'm not sure about is if you have foreign investments held in the US, and
	your US broker pays the relevant foreign taxes for you, and reports the amount so
	that you can use it as foreign tax credit in your US returns. Can you report this
	amount in DA-1? Morally I feel you should be able to, to avoid double taxation,
	but I can't be sure about the legal answer.

 1. Annex R-US 164, _Demande en remboursement de la retenue supplémentaire d'impôt
    USA 20XX_, or Request for refund of US supplemental withholding tax 20XX (replace with actual year). This is
    where it gets tricky. I believe this is for US investments made through _Swiss_
    brokers, who automatically withhold some tax as a compliance measure (maybe
    something about FATCA and the vagaries of the US-Swiss tax treaties?), so that
    you have to file a return to get it back. I don't think this applies for US
    investments made in the US.

Lastly, two points worth clarifying. One, that the Canton of Vaud's tax return filing
deadline is March 15, a month before your US federal tax return is due, although
Vaud is known to unofficially grant automatic extensions until June. Two, that the
cantons collect the federal, cantonal, and communal taxes in Switzerland, so you only
have to file one return. Good luck!


# The full context

## Banking

The US passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in 2010 to try to reduce
tax evasion and money laundering by US citizens holding foreign financial accounts. One
important aspect of FATCA is that it requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs)
to report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) certain information about accounts
and assets held by US persons, or face a 30% withholding tax on all US-sourced
payments of income. This was basically the IRS strong-arming FFIs into collecting
taxpayer identification information from US-affiliated account holders and complying with
the IRS' reporting requirements. Most FFIs complied rather than risk losing US
business. Not so with the Swiss.

Swiss banking secrecy laws made it downright _illegal_ for banks to share the sort of
information about their banking relationships that the IRS was asking them to
share. And beyond the law, FATCA was antithetical to the Swiss culture of privacy,
and many in Switzerland did not see why they should compromise their values in
deference to the IRS, especially when the banking establishment in Switzerland is
centuries older than even the concept of the United States of America.

So the gut instinct of some Swiss banks was simply to terminate US accounts and
not open any new ones because they didn't think the regulatory hassle was worth
it. Many US citizens were, understandably, very upset by this. This is the time period
and incident that sets off alarms in the collective memory of the Swiss when you
speak of US citizens and banking. Thankfully, that era of turmoil has passed, and many
Swiss FFIs have done the required registration with the IRS, and are taking US
clients with some extra paperwork.

## Credit cards

America runs on ~~Dunkin'~~ debt. In a sense, all economies have always run on
debt, but it's very visible in America: you have to take a student loan to go to
college, your societal standing is determined by your credit score, Congress has to
keep increasing the federal debt limit, the Fed sets an interest rate on inter-bank
loans that wreaks havoc with global monetary policy, … and of course, everyone
pays for everything by credit card.

A brief technical digression about credit cards follows but I promise it's worth
it. Credit cards involve four transacting parties: the consumer (e.g. you), the
issuer (e.g. Wells Fargo), the network (e.g. Visa), and the vendor
(e.g. Starbucks). Visa convinces Starbucks to accept Visa cards because it will
make it more convenient for you to buy coffee from Starbucks and hence more coffee
will be bought. Visa also promises Starbucks that they will receive payments on a
short timescale, even if you actually pay off your credit card bills on a long
timescale or not at all. For these reasons, Starbucks pays[^3] Visa a portion of all
sales made with Visa cards. This is called the _interchange fee_. Visa uses the
proceeds from interchange fees to pay[^4] you _cashback_ and other rewards.[^5]

Visa and Wells Fargo make a lot of money when you pay Starbucks with a Visa card, and
even more money when you don't pay Wells Fargo the full balance back right away.
Which is why it seems like everyone is hopping on one foot to sell you a credit card
in the US, with offers like "3% cashback on all groceries" or "$200 cashback if you
spend $1,000 in the first 3 months". Because credit cards are so ubiquitous, Starbucks
sets their prices to account for the interchange fees they will have to pay for the
predictable portion of transactions that will happen via credit card. Thus it is
sound financial advice in the US to get and use a credit card because if you don't
then you are just paying for cashback for those who do.[^6]

So what about Europe? (Including Switzerland for this paragraph.) Well, EU financial
regulators capped the interchange fee at 0.3% in 2015, citing a variety of reasons:
the Single Market philosophy, leveling the playing field for innovation, fairness for
retailers, the fact that rewards move money from the poor to the rich, etc. (not all
of which I agree with). Compare that to US interchange fees which are typically in
the 1–3% range. Consequently, credit card rewards programs are meager in
Europe, and cashback if it exists is no more than 0.3% for cards without an annual
fee. You will notice an accompanying striking lack of credit card marketing and much
lower usage of credit cards.[^1]

## Investing in Switzerland

Don't. The main reason is that if you do, you will enter tax hell, both in the sense
that you will be taxed at a very high rate on investment returns, and that your tax
returns will become very complicated. This is due to laws about ownership interest in
foreign companies and Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs) which to
understand you _really_ need a professional tax advisor.

You could _maybe_ try to get around this by only investing in US companies but then
why not just invest from a US brokerage account instead? (If you don't have one,
you'll have to open one before you leave, and leaving afterwards is no problem.) If
you want to invest in the European market, you could buy shares (in USD) of ETFs
composed of European companies, so that the broker handles the complicated foreign
investment taxation while you technically only own shares of US ETFs. You could even
think of these shares as being priced in CHF (the currency you originally converted
from) so that their effective value, for you, doesn't depend on the exchange
rate. Needless to say, this is all very speculative and shaky advice, even more so
than anything else on this page, and don't blame me if you lose money.

There are also tax implications for Pillar 3a retirement savings. The standard advice for people living and working in Switzerland is to
contribute to Pillar 3a retirement savings, because they grow in value as they
are invested in the market and the returns are taxed at a preferential rate, much
like IRAs in the US. But these are foreign investments, and as discussed above, US
persons should stay away from foreign investments. If anyone starts to try selling
you a Pillar 3a plan, tell them you're a US citizen, and they will immediately leave
you alone.

[^1]: But if you ask anyone about it, they'll say, "No, we use credit cards all the
      time! I hardly carry cash these days." But they would be confusing credit cards
      with _debit cards_, which are radically different, which just goes to show how
      deep the non-credit card culture is.

[^2]: There is some nuance here. If you are moving into Vaud from abroad (but not
      from a different Swiss canton) partway through a year, the tax _rate_ for your
      Swiss income is determined by proportionally scaling that income to the whole
      year, and this is reflected in the source deductions you will see on your
      paystubs. But there is an automatic 16,000 CHF deduction from your taxable
      income for the benefit of _contribuables modestes_ (low-income taxpayers) which
      means that with an EPFL PhD student's salary, your taxable income for the first
      (partial) year will be zero.

[^3]: Or rather, Starbucks' bank pays Visa a variable portion of each incoming
      payment from Visa in Starbucks' name, depending on several factors. Starbucks pays
      its bank a relatively simpler fee.

[^4]: Through the issuer, Wells Fargo, of course, whose rewards program also makes Wells
      Fargo some money. Cashback is also funded by interest on balances, late payment
      fees, annual fees, advertizing revenue, etc.

[^5]: Why do they offer cashback? Because it incentivizes you to buy more, making
      them more money, and proving the point they pitched to Starbucks in the
      beginning. Visa can also _selectively_ offer more or less cashback on purchases
      with certain vendors, which means they can charge Dunkin' extra to advertize
      itself over Starbucks with special cashback offers. With full knowledge of your
      spending habits and demographic categories, Visa can push very targeted
      cashback offers to you, which means they can charge Dunkin' extra extra to
      promote itself to, say, middle-class consumers who live in neighborhoods with
      equal Starbucks and Dunkin' presence who don't currently buy coffee
      regularly. Mwahahaha…

[^6]: It is also sound financial advice because it is how you build a credit score,
      which determines your societal standing, as mentioned
      previously. Unfortunately, poorer people are systemically excluded from the
      financial system… and also are more likely to pay by cash (because they get
      _paid_ in cash), or only get approved for credit cards with less cashback
      (because they are
      riskier clients for Wells Fargo, and have lower credit scores). Which means
      that cashback is a great system for moving money from the poor to the rich.

[^7]: (? ikr)

[^8]: But note that it is a _good thing_ that EPFL contributes to your retirement
      savings plan. In the US, employer-matched retirement plans fall into two
      categories: FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), also known as Social
      Security and Medicare contributions, that the employer must deduct from
      employee paychecks _and_ must match on their own; and 401(k) plans, which
      employers can optionally choose to offer as a benefit to employees, and match
      contributions up to an extent. _US universities are exempt from FICA
      contributions for grad students and virtually never offer 401(k)s._ This means
      PhD students in the US are years behind on retirement savings by the time they
      enter the "real workforce", after having done very real work for meager pay.
