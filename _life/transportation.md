## Public Transportation
Train in Switzerland is very expensive without discounts. Fortunately for PhDs, various discounts are available both for local public transportation in Lausanne (Mobilis) and throughout Switzerland (CFF).

### Local public transportation
EPFL subsidizes monthly or yearly travel passes for public transports. On myCAMIPRO, EPFL employees can get a 15% discount coupon on transport passes. It will be valid when purchasing your pass in a point of sale (SBB, TL, ...) nearby. [Discount from EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/mobility/public-transport/mobilis-subsidy/)

### Switzerland by train
* As a PhD at EPFL, you are entitled to a free “Demi-Tarif” card, which gives you very interesting discounts on public transportation throughout Switzerland. More informations on this webpage.

* The SBB [seven-25](https://www.sbb.ch/de/abos-billette/abonnemente/seven25-abo.html) program allows people under 25 with a valid “Demi-tarif” Card to travel anywhere in Switzerland between 7pm to 5am for 390 CHF/year or 39 CHF/month

* Super saver tickets

## Car
You came in Switzerland with your own car? You want to rent a car for a short term excursion? This section is then for you! In these subsections, we gathered the existing information about easy car rentals and parkings.

Parking rules at EPFL can be found [here](https://parking.epfl.ch/homepage).

### Car sharing
Thanks to its RFID compatibility, the CAMIPRO card gives you access to services that are external to the Campus, like [the car sharing service Mobility](http://www.mobility.ch/), for which the EPFL got discounts for its students and staff. In order to benefit from this service, you have to register on myCAMIPRO (with login).

### Car rental
You can get special discounts with Europcar with a Camipro. See our Finances page for more details on the discount.

## Bike
Whether you are an unconditional biker that would rather spend your money on a nice bike than on a year Mobility pass or you simply enjoy biking once in a while, then this section is for you.
