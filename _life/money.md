## Bank accounts

Go with whichever Swiss bank you want, they’re all more or less equal, and will have free accounts for students. The main question is whether you want a more traditional account or an app-based one like CSX or Yuh.
If you are a US citizen, the process will be more complex due to Swiss banks having to report your data to the US.

Switzerland as a whole is in the process of moving away from Maestro for debit cards and towards Debit MasterCard/Visa, but until that is finished (2022?)
depending on your bank you may need to get a credit card just so you can do online shopping, without actually using the credit part. Generally, it’s possible to pay for almost everything by card (cashless).

You can pay most if not all recurring bills, such as insurance or phone, with the "e-Bill" system. In your bank's online portal, go to the e-Bill section and look up your service providers to register.

Do not expect any yields from non-investment bank accounts, even the savings ones, due to negative interest rates on CHF.


## Pay

The pay for PhD students is set at the federal level. As of 2021, it is 52,400 CHF/year for the first year, and increases by 1,000 CHF/year in each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years.
([source](https://inside.epfl.ch/internalhr/fr/prestationsrh/salaires/forfaits/))

There is one slightly unusual factor to take into account: the 13th salary.
The 13th salary system means that your salary is split into 13 and you get 1/13th each month,
with the last 1/13th being given to you partly in November and partly in December.
The origins of this system are historically not so clear, but nowadays it’s basically a way for you to pay for Christmas presents and such.

Overall, expect to get around 3,200 CHF/month after all taxes starting in the first year, plus the 13th salary. Here's an example breakdown for a first year monthly PhD salary **as of September 2017** (the amounts will have slightly changed since then):
This is from a non-November/December months, in those months it would be more due to the 13th salary mentioned above.

| Gross salary             | 3,930.80 CHF |
| First pillar (AHV/AVS)   | -201.45 CHF  |
| Various other deductions | -88.15 CHF   |
| Second pillar (Publica)  | -137.10 CHF  |
| Income tax               | -279.50 CHF  |
| **Net income**               | **3,224.60 CHF** |


## First pillar

Mandatory retirement savings, taken out of the salary, as a global pool for everyone. Called "AVS". Equivalent to "social security".

## Second pillar

Mandatory retirement savings, taken out of the salary, for yourself. Provider is always [Publica](https://publica.ch/) for EPFL employees.
Money is blocked until retirement or "permanently" leaving the country.

## Third pillar

Optional retirement savings for yourself. The money contributed to the Pillar 3a can be deducted from income for tax purposes.
Capped to about CHF 7000 per year (the exact amount increases slightly every year).
You can view this as an investment with a high return since its tax-deductible nature drastically lowers your taxes (see below).

Money is blocked until retirement, "permanently" leaving the country, buying a house or starting to work as an independent.
At withdrawal, a progressive tax rate is applied depending on the capital amount and your canton of residence. ([source](https://finpension.ch/en/capital-withdrawal-tax-compared/))

You get to choose where you invest, so it can be a near-zero-return but safe option (e.g. 100% cash), or up to 100% in stocks with, e.g., VIAC or PostFinance. 
Make sure you compare fees before choosing a solution: keeping it in cash should be free everywhere, but if you want to invest, your bank’s offering probably won’t be the cheapest.

In general, it’s not worth it to subscribe to a joint life insurance / third pillar product (a.k.a. "Pillar 3b"), even though salespeople may try to convince you otherwise.


## Taxes

Switzerland has taxes on your income (i.e., salary) and your wealth (i.e., money in your bank account(s), possessions such as a car).
Taxes are levied by the federal government, cantons, and communes; this means the amount you pay in tax can vary depending on where you live in the country.

There are two ways to pay taxes: "at the source", default for people who are not permanent residents, and with "acomptes", for Swiss citizens, permanent residents, and some other cases.
Paying taxes at the source means they are deducted directly from your salary, with no action necessary on your part.
Paying taxes with acomptes means you get a bill at the start of the year and have to pay part of it each month, with the easiest option being to register for an e-Bill on your online banking so approval is one click once a year.

If you have a B permit, _AND_ your net worth is lower than 50,000 CHF, _AND_ your yearly income is lower than 120,000 CHF, _AND_ you have no investments such as indexed funds,
_AND_ you do not have a 3a pillar or other significant deductions,
you do not need to do anything for taxes. You are taxed at the source and that's it.

If you have a B permit but do not meet one of the criteria above, typically because you have a 3a pillar, you must request an "ulterior ordinary taxation", or "taxation ordinaire ultérieure" in French.
The form to request one is on the [Vaud website](https://www.vd.ch/themes/etat-droit-finances/impots/pour-les-employeurs/impot-a-la-source/personnes-imposees-a-la-source-sourciers/).
Once this is done, you keep being taxed at the source but you follow the procedure detailed next to declare your taxes. This cannot be undone, once requested you will declare your taxes every year.

If you have to file your taxes, typically because you requested so (above) or because you are Swiss, you will receive a letter at the start of the next year with informations.
You then need to file your taxes using [VaudTax](https://www.vd.ch/themes/etat-droit-finances/impots/impots-pour-les-individus/remplir-ma-declaration-dimpot/prestation-vaudtax/), a website which is basically a giant form.

You need to declare your information, income, and wealth. To do so, first get the following documents and information:
- The letter you got from the tax office that includes your "n° de contribuable" and the "code de contrôle" (the latter changes each year)
- Your salary certificate from EPFL's SESAME portal (see below)
- For each bank account you had on the 31st of December of the elapsed year (in any country/currency), the account number, amount of money there was on the account on that date, and the interest you earned for the year
  - If you opened that account in the elapsed year, you additionally need the opening date
- For each bank account you closed during the elapsed year, the account number and closing date
- The amount of money you paid for health insurance in the elapsed year (typically your health insurance gives you a PDF at the end of the year)
- The amount of money you paid for rent, _without_ "charges" (this should be in your rental contract)
- If you have a 3a pillar, the PDF from your bank stating how much money you put in for the year

To file your taxes, open the VaudTax website, log in with your n° de contribuable and code de contrôle (_not_ in simulation mode), and then:
- First, a warning: most of the boxes for numbers do not accept cents, but may screw up your copy/paste and include the cents but not the separator, leading to e.g. 1000 instead of 10.00, so double-check what you paste
- Fill in "Identification", being very careful about the IBAN because that is the account you will get the tax refund on
- Fill in "Contribuable 1"
- Under "Activités salariées" > "Principale, ...", add your EPFL job; the "ch. XX" refer to number XX on your EPFL salary certificate
  - For number 15, on the second page of the certificate there is "Cotisations PC Familles vaudoises YY CHF ..", put in that YY
- Under "Frais professionnels"
  - "Frais de transport", add your commute to EPFL, typically 240 days in a year, use Google Maps' pedestrian itinerary to see the number of km, and pick "Forfait"
  - "Frais de repas", add your meals, typically the same number of days as above
- Under "Primes et cotisations d'assurances" > "Cotisations d'assurances (prévoyance)"
  - Put your health insurance costs
  - If you have a 3a pillar, put the amount for that year in the corresponding box
  - The rest will typically be empty (0 for the subsidy box)
- Under "Etats des titres"
  - Under "Comptes et livrets bancaires, ...", add each of your accounts, including those closed during that year; you can use Google for the exchange rates on the 31st of December for any foreign currency accounts
    - Your interest is typically not subject to withholding tax, unless you are sure it is
  - Under "Fonds de placement", put any indexed funds you are investing in, if applicable
- Under "Autres éléments de fortune et revenus de fortune", put any other wealth you have such as a car
- Under "Déductions spéciales sur le revenu"
  - "Déduction sociale pour le logement", input your yearly rent without charges
  - For the other parts, if applicable, put any donations you made to charities or political parties, as well as medical costs during the year
- Under "Acomptes" > "Total des acomptes payés...", put your "acomptes" if you paid some and the taxes already paid à la source if applicable
  - This is crucial, and as of 2022 the software does not automatically sync the à la source amount with the one you declared on your job, so don't skip this step
- In the right sidebar, under "Outils" > "Gérer des pièces justificatives", in the second group you must upload your 3a certificate for the year, if applicable; nothing else
- You can then check the entire computation using "Outils" in the right sidebar > "Calculer les impôts".
  - For an average PhD student with a 3a pillar maxed out for the year, the taxes should be 2.5-3k, and the "solde" should be _negative_ 2-2.5k, meaning they owe you money back
  - If it's your first year and you joined around September, you likely owe 0 in actual taxes and thus will get all of your à la source paid taxes back, typically 1.5k
  - Without a 3a pillar your "solde" will be around zero or even positive, so there is no point in doing a "taxation ordinaire ultérieure" in that case unless you have to
- You can then finish by clicking on "Transmettre" in the right sidebar > "Vérifier..." and clicking on the confirmation buttons
  - Once it's done, download all three documents you can download: two are PDF statements, and one is a ZIP that will make the process much easier next year as you can simply import it and only edit what changed

After a little delay, a taxation decision will be made and you get refunded (or charged, if you had not paid enough).


## Checks

Don't. It is possible to cash checks, but this has large fees, because nobody uses them in Switzerland.


## Transferring money to & from abroad

While it is possible to make a direct bank transfer from anywhere to Switzerland, that could result in large transfer and currency conversion fees.
A cheaper way is to use a service such as [Wise](https://wise.com/) (formerly Transferwise), where fees are small and known upfront.

Wise and Revolut both offer payment cards that can be used in any country and for online shopping with cheap / free currency conversion.
