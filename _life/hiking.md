Interested in hiking but not sure how to get started?
Worried about whether you're fit enough to complete a hike?
Or perhaps you have done a few hikes and want to know more?
You've come to the right place!
This document is aimed at beginner hikers living in Switzerland and targets hikes that can be completed a single day, without camping overnight.


## Getting started

First, make sure you have a good map.
The [Switzerland Mobility app](https://schweizmobil.ch/en/switzerlandmobility-app) is an amazing free app that has all of Switzerland accurately mapped with routes for hiking, cycling, skiing, and other snow sports.
All routes, geographical features, and transport options are marked.
Some even have explanations and suggestions for a day hike.
Avoid using Google Maps or other general-purpose maps as your primary sources, since they are sometimes inaccurate in the mountains.
The app also has a paid feature for 30 CHF/year where you can plot your own routes and measure the distance, elevation profile and time taken.
If you don't want to spend the money, you can use similar features on the open source [Swiss Topo](https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=en&topic=ech&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&layers=ch.swisstopo.zeitreihen,ch.bfs.gebaeude_wohnungs_register,ch.bav.haltestellen-oev,ch.swisstopo.swisstlm3d-wanderwege,ch.astra.wanderland-sperrungen_umleitungen&layers_opacity=1,1,1,0.8,0.8&layers_visibility=false,false,false,true,false&layers_timestamp=18641231,,,,&E=2632111.02&N=1167554.75&zoom=7) which also has a mobile app and more overlay maps (e.g., snow depth).

Second, make sure you know how to read your map.
The best way to get used to reading a hiking map is to go on a few simple hikes.
Remember that your phone's GPS location may not always be up-to-date in the mountains, so use your judgement at times to avoid wasting time in paths you didn't intend to take.

Third, look out for signs during your hike to confirm you're going the right way.
Virtually all hikes contain arrow signs that indicate directions and times to points of interests.
There are also frequent yellow diamond and arrow signs on the ground, on rocks, and on trees to reassure you that you have not strayed off course.
These signs are managed by the same association that manages the Swiss Mobility app.


## Types of hikes

There are roughly three categories of hikes:

1. Easy walking paths, marked with yellow signs
2. Mountain hiking paths which require good shoes, marked with white-red-white signs
3. Alpine hiking paths which require serious equipment, marked with white-blue-white signs

The Swiss Mobility app displays these three categories as yellow, red, and blue respectively.
The other most relevant parameters when choosing on a hike are the walking distance and the elevation.
In addition, the app has a "fitness level" required for the hike. Even easier hikes can require a high level of fitness if they are very long.

The Swiss Alpine Club has [a more detailed classification](https://www.sac-cas.ch/fileadmin/Ausbildung_und_Wissen/Sicher_unterwegs/Sicher_unterwegs_Wandern/2020_Berg_Alpinwanderskala_EN.pdf) ranging from T1 (easy) to T6 (very difficult), if you are interested.

Note that "via ferratas" are not considered hikes and are essentially between hiking and mountaineering. They have a different difficulty scale.

Some more useful resources on types of hikes:
- [The Swiss Alps and hiking - what you need to know before you go for a walk (Swiss Photo Spots)](https://www.swissphotospots.com/post/swiss-alps-and-hiking-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-go-for-a-walk) 
- [Alpine, mountaineering & hiking grades (Berg Freunde)](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/alpine-grades-calculator/) 
- [The Swiss Alpine Club hiking scale (The Weekend Mountaineer)](https://theweekendmountaineer.ch/the-swiss-alpine-club-hiking-scale/)


## Winter hiking and snowshoeing

You can still hike in the winter!
You can do winter hiking which is just hiking on the snow. Many ski resorts prepare safe paths for winter hiking.
You can also snowshoe, which is hiking on snow with snowshoes or *raquettes* in French.
They have a large surface area allowing you to walk on snow without sinking.
You can find snowshoeing trails marked in pink on the Switzerland Mobility app, as well as at many ski resorts.


## Planning a hike

First, time.
While apps such as Swiss Mobility give you an estimated time, you will probably want to add 2--3 hours to account for breaks and unforeseen events.
Also, if you travel in a large group, you tend to go slower.
As a beginner, start with simple hikes, which are flatter, and gradually increase distance and elevation gain/loss to increase your confidence and better estimate how fast you walk.

Second, weather.
The weather determines the hike feasibility, and in particular mountain hikes should be avoided when it is rainy/snowy as it can be quite dangerous.
Even in spring or fall, there may be snow at higher elevations, which you can sometimes check on online webcams from tourism offices.
Check the weather before the hike, and don't be afraid to reassess the weather situation during your hike and look for shelter early if needed.
The Swiss government has a good [weather app (MeteoSwiss)](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch). There's also [mountain-forecast.com](https://mountain-forecast.com/).
For snow, use [whiterisk.ch](https://whiterisk.ch), [wepowder.com](https://wepowder.com/en), and [windy.com](https://www.windy.com/en/-New-snow-snowAccu).

Third, transport.
The start and end points of many hikes are reachable by public transport, and for non-loop hikes you will need public transport even if you come with your own car.
As you go for more mountainous and remote start points, the frequency of public transport gets lower, usually once an hour with the last bus/train sometimes as early as 5pm.
Double-check the schedule of public transport you plan to use, as in some cases you will have to start your day very early.
Some options to help reduce costs while hiking are the CFF's youth day pass, saver day pass, and in Vaud, the Mobilis pass.

Fourth, equipment.
Get yourself a good compact bag, or at least a backpack if you're just starting, and use the following checklist:
- **Tickets**: any public transport tickets you need.
- **Shoes**: the most important piece of equpment is good hiking shoes.
  If you are not sure how serious you are about hiking, get some cheap hiking boots from a store like Decathlon for about 60 CHF or some trail running shoes,
  which are good for easy hikes, and you can use them for everyday wear if you ever decide to upgrade.
  For more serious hikes, get shoes with ankle support, but the tradeoff is that the shoes get more bulky.
- **Poles**: if you're doing serious downhill regularly (800+ m), get hiking poles so your arms can support your weight, thus protecting your legs, increasing your hiking lifespan, and giving you more balance.
  You can get cheap poles for 25 CHF per pole, which work fine.
  (Tip for hiking steep downhill: walk in a zigzag path. This increases your distance walked and reduces gradient. Many hiking routes also do this on steep terrain with switchbacks, also to protect nature.)
- **Clothes**: a good shirt and jeans work fine. You could also use running clothes or hiking pants.
  Jeans work even in the cold and while traversing rough terrain, but be aware that they can be burdensome if they get wet due to rain or crossing water.
  You should probably also wear at least a thin jacket, and a thicker one plus gloves if you are going for high altitudes.
  Switzerland hiking is all about layers as it can be cold early in the morning, sunny at noon, and cold again when you reach the top of the mountain.
- **Shades**: recommended in strong sunlight to protect your eyes.
  Also useful if you are near snow where the sunlight reflects a lot. If you wear glasses, consider investing in a pair of prescription sunglasses to avoid the awkwardness of wearing sunglasses over your glasses.
- **Sunscreen**: a must for long summer day hikes.
- **First aid**: at least enough to deal with small cuts and injuries you sustain on the hike: band-aids and sanitizer.
- **Power bank**: if you don't trust your phone to last an entire day, pack one of these to ensure you can always read your map.
- **Water**: a good rule of thumb is 1 liter per 2 hours of hiking.
  In Switzerland, there are usually fountains to refill water but they tend to be near populated regions and are scarce in the mountains.
  If you are high enough, you can even refill with some alpine waterfalls/streams. Also make sure to carry enough food/snacks.
- **Food**: get snacks like trail mix, biscuits and chocolates.
  You probably also want to pack lunch, such as sandwiches.
  Some hikes also have barbecue spots, so you could light a fire and barbecue food, but check to see if they are open beforehand.
  There may be a restaurant or mountain hut on your hiking route which is a good spot to refill on water and food.

_Tip: Keep everything prepared for the hike ready the previous night including the clothes you have to wear. This helps you make less decisions early in the morning and reduces the chance of forgetting something._

If you're really serious, you could get a headlight and a rope for emergency situations, hydration packs with a straw, as well as physical maps to not worry about your phone dying. But that's probably too much for 99% of situations.


## Wildlife

One nice thing about hiking in Switzerland is that you don't have to worry about wild animals attacking you. If you are lucky you may spot some marmots and eagles!

- **Cows**: the most common animal you will spot on your hikes.
  They are present on farms and some hiking paths pass through these farms.
  Note that they have electric fences but usually have a gate with a Cow-Captcha to only allow humans through.
  However, please be careful passing through cow herds, especially if there are young calves around, as mother cows can be aggressive if you get too close.
  Swiss cows are usually used to human presence but they can be aggressive.
  _Always remain calm and do not run away from the cows as this only worsens the situation._
- **Guard dogs**: sometimes, especially in Valais and in the Bernese Oberland, guard dogs accompany herds of sheep or goat.
  First, slowly approach the dog and herd and if the dog remains calm, calmly pass through.
  If they are aggressive, find an alternate path around while not disturbing the animals.
  If you have your own dog, make sure it is on a leash before proceeding.
  For more information, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PndPqCN865g).
- **Ticks**: according to the [Swiss government](https://www.ch.ch/en/health/ticks/),
  all cantons apart from Geneva and Ticino are considered tick risk areas.
  Usually they are present in farms, fields, and forests up to an altitude of 1500m.
  Ticks are more active in warm and humid conditions, especially from March to November. What to do to protect yourself:
    - Wear clothing that covers your entire body.
    - Use an anti-tick spray on shoes and the parts of the body that come into contact with grass and bushes. 
    - Stay on wide paths and avoid contact with grass and bushes. 
    - Check your clothing and uncovered body regularly.
    - If you live in a risk area, a vaccination against meningitis (TBE) may be worthwhile. Discuss this with your doctor or pharmacist.


## Safety

> "Getting to the top is optional. Getting down is mandatory." -- Ed Viesturs (mountaineer)

While people you will meet on hikes are nice, the biggest danger is the mountains itself.
You are free to explore the mountains at your leisure, but this also means many times there are no barriers stopping you from attempting very dangerous activities.

If you are hiking alone, it's important to let someone know your hiking route for the day in case of emergency.
Even as recently as Feb 2024, [some hikers died](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/dutch-family-dies-in-hiking-accident-in-swiss-mountains/49202692) while hiking in the snow/ice at Rochers de Naye.

Also, be very careful when attempting difficult hikes (SAC's T4 and above).
These hikes are rated difficult for a reason. Preferably attempt these with a hiking partner with more experience.
Also, even T3 rated hikes can be dangerous out of season, due to snow, ice, and scree.
Every year, many people get into [hiking accidents](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/mountain-accidents-in-switzerland-the-figures/47805430).
Read the [SAC safety tips](https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/training-and-safety/safety/safety-when-hiking/) before you add to that number.

If you have an emergency while hiking:
1. Keep calm and assess the situation.
2. Warn others and ensure the safety of everyone.
3. Organize as a group. Distribute tasks such as calling for help, providing first aid, looking for shelter, finding landing spots for helicopters, documenting the situation, etc.

If you need rescuing, call REGA's phone number, 1414, or use their app.
Their service is run by donations and patrons and they are incredibly efficient.
However, you will get charged for their services, which are _not_ covered by your mandatory health insurance.
The REGA app is also quite useful with which they can trace your location.
You can also ask them to check on you regularly if you go solo hiking/camping in the mountains.

If you have no connection through your cell phone network, you can always call the international emergency phone number, 112, through other networks.
If you have no connection at all, look for elevated spots, and in the worst case, hike to the next mountain hut or village.

A subscription to REGA drastically lowers the costs of their rescue services should you ever need them, for only 40 CHF/year.
Also consider getting a SAC member subscription if you want to do more mountain activities, as they have many member discounts for living in huts and taking mountaineering courses.


## General hiking culture

Hiking in Switzerland is an amazing social activity.
You can meet lots of interesting people and even make friends through hikes, such as using the #hiking channel of the EPFL IC PhD slack to find other people interested in hiking.
The EPFL Club Montagne is another great way to meet like-minded people, as they organize hikes and other mountain-related activities.

In general, people are super nice and helpful on the mountains and you should be as well.
Always greet other hikers: *bonjour*/*salut* on the French side or *Grüss Gott* on the German side.
Other hikers can also give advice and take photos for you!

Remember to follow the principles of [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/): the idea being to minimize your impact on nature.
The most important rule is to not leave trash behind. I recommend carrying a plastic bag to collect all trash to dispose later post-hike.

Do not be too self-conscious: Swiss people are hiking beasts, and you will frequently be overtaken by young children or by elderly people.
When the Swiss say a hike is easy, it's probably not as easy as you imagine.
Keep hiking and one day you too will be doing Swiss-difficult hikes!


## Finding hiking routes

Some useful sites for inspiration:
- [Swiss Family Fun](https://swissfamilyfun.com/) (for easier hikes and family friendly activities; also read their ["hiking 101"](https://swissfamilyfun.com/category/hiking101/) category)
- [Vaud Loisirs](https://vaudloisirs.ch/idees-de-loisirs/) (leisure activities in Vaud, not just hiking)
- [HikingWalking.com](http://www.hikingwalking.com/destinations/sw/) 
- [Hikes for Loners and independent types](https://www.noth.ch/en/randos/index.html)
- [Swiss Top 32](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/summer-autumn/hiking/32-most-enjoyable-hikes-search/)

Jura is easy and more accessible in the spring and fall.
The Alps are more amazing and difficult and usually accessible only late spring to early fall since once it starts raining, it snows in the mountains.

Don't hesitate to stare at a hiking route map and make your own route, which gives you a lot more freedom and lets you adjust the difficulty.
Often there are gondolas/lifts/trains connecting parts of the mountain to the down below.
To save your legs, plan on hiking uphill and then a bit downhill and then taking the transport down.
You can also take lifts both ways, leading to quite flat hiking in the middle.

Another interesting route option is to combine an easy hike with a cultural activity at the end like a city/museum visit.
Very possible in the Neuchatel, Biel/Bienne, Fribourg area with options like the Absinthe museum, Papiliorama, Panzermuseum, and so on.

One final tip: you can experience how people moved in the past with day hikes by hiking from one place to another and staying at a different place every night.
Many routes were made for this purpose, such as the *Via Francigena* (road to Rome), *Tour du Mont Blanc* (around Mont Blanc via 3 countries),
and *Via Alpina* (across the alps, where J. R. R. Tolkien saw Lauterbrunnen, the most beautiful place on Earth and the inspiration for the Elvish settlement of Rivendell).
These routes have sections and you cover one section every day which is why most sections end in towns or at mountain huts.

## SAC Huts
The Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) has many huts in the mountains where you can stay.
They are very useful if you are planning to do a multi-day hike or if you just want to spend a day in the mountains.
[Read more information about the facilities and how to book them.](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/summer-autumn/hiking/alpine-passes-trail/sac-huetten/)
If you plan to stay more than two nights a year, it's probably worth it to become a SAC member as you then get discounts.
Remember that many huts get fully booked out in peak summer season, so make sure to book early.
