## What is expected from you in the 1st year
In your first year you have a lot of responsibilities like the depth course, the 1st and 2nd semester projects, and the candidacy exam. If you are a fellowship student, you do not have a lab yet and spend most of your time in the common office, where other 1st year students gather and work. In the meanwhile, if your colleagues are publishing but you don’t have anything in the pipeline, don’t stress out. It’s okay if you don’t write a paper in your first year. The first year is about showing that you **can** do it, you don’t need to actually do it yet. Focus on finding a lab, and passing your courses and semester projects. Also get familiar with our recommended tools, they will make your life easier!

## Common space
The common office is awesome, you can hang out with people who are on the same boat as you, socialize and, once in a while, it’s even possible to get some work done there. Even if you’re already affiliated, drop by to meet the other first year students - there are usually people up for procrastination, i.e. having a coffee or a beer with you!
