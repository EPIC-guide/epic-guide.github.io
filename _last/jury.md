1. Who chooses jury depends on the lab
2. You should have discussion with your supervisor about it
3. If you have preferences, talk about them. In particular, you should be able to veto any jury member, if you think they are problematic in some way
4. Some people say, pick experienced jury members. [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0307507022000011507)
5. What examiners do? [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02602938.2013.859230)
6. Formalities
    - Prepare list of jury members (president, internal EPFL member, 2 external members)
    - Prepare a number of potential dates of your private defence
    - Invite jury members (sometimes your supervisor does that)
    - Inform the external members about epfl customs (they will have 5 weeks to read the thesis, they can come in person or via videoconference)
    - Once everyone agrees on the date, fill in the form in ISA
    - Sign the form and get your supervisor signature (atm can be paper or electronic signature) and deliver to EDIC (Annalisa Ginocchio)
    - Donâ€™t panic when you get more forms to sign: they will be signed at you private defence
    - Pay the fee for gods knows what, finishing your phd? Anyway, you have to pay it, your lab cannot pay for it, you can pay by card or by transfer, transfer takes more time
