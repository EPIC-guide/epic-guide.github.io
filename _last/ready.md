1. Most of us are never ready, but that’s OK
2. Be proactive and talk to your supervisor about when you want to finish, don’t just wait
3. Some groups have a “thesis proposal” that is supposed to happen a year before the end of your PhD. This is not mandatory, but it’s a good exercise to reflect on what you have done and what you can realistically do in a year
4. If you think you are on your final semester, and do not TA, and then extend your thesis by a semester you might be asked to TA again
