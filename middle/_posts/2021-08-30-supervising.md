Bachelor and Master students at EPFL must complete “semester projects” in labs. They are worth a lot of credits, so they spend significant time on them.

PhD students are often tasked with coming up with project topics, and more importantly supervise the students. This typically means meeting with them once per week to check their progress, help them get unstuck, etc.

**Pro tip:** Master students are great! They can make some interesting contributions to your work. Do not assign essential parts of your research but interesting branches that you might want to explore later.
