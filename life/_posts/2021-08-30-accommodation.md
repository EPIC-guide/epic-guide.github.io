As you may already know, finding housing in Lausanne is not easy. We regroup here many existing resources and links to help you in your search:

* [Internal EPFL platform](http://logement.epfl.ch/PhD): This platform provides housing offers addressed directly to the EPFL community.
* [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/330486193693264/): Lausanne a Louer -Bouche à Oreille. This Facebook group is not reserved for the EPFL community, so the competition is hard, but there are a lot of offers continuously
* #housing channel in the [IC PhD Slack](http://tinyurl.com/ic-phd-slack)

In general, if you're planning to rent out an apartment directly from a private landlord or an agency as the main tenant, it requires certain paperwork that you will only be able to do once you arrive. The standard set of documents that would typically be needed is

* Valid Swiss residency permit (OR at least a Certificate d'inscription)
* Last three payslips (OR if not available at minimum current employment certificate)
* Extrait du registre des poursuites (can be requested [here](https://www.vd.ch/prestation-detail/prestation/demander-un-extrait-du-registre-des-poursuites-pour-soi-meme/?tx_vdprestations_pi4%5Bcontroller%5D=Prestation&tx_vdprestations_pi4%5Baction%5D=show&cHash=fa375835ef87030e235f9b5d7cd01b2f) once you have registered)
* Proof of home insurance (optional but strongly recommended for your dossier to be considered)

An alternative is always to provide these documents for a Swiss guarantor whose name would be on the lease rather than for you personally.
