## EPFL/UNIL Sport Center
The UNIL-EPFL sports center offers a lot of activities that you can find listed [here](https://sport.unil.ch/?pid=24). (in French).

To access the sports center, you need a membership card that costs 120 CHF/semester or 200 CHF/year for EPFL PhD students. You can find more information on their [website](http://sport.unil.ch/?mid=129).

The annual cards are valid from the 1st of September to the 30th of September of the next year. You can get that membership card at the “Villa des Sports” which is indicated on [this map](https://www.google.ch/maps/place/UNIL+-+Villa+des+sports/@46.519082,6.5748983,898m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x478c305495792713:0xb4e4d4b33f0eecfb!8m2!3d46.519082!4d6.577087?hl=en).

The UNIL-EPFL Sports organize sport sessions over lunchtime on the EPFL campus. They are supervised by a trained instructor. Two types of sessions are organized and the themes are often varied:

* The shot sessions are 30-minutes sport sessions from 12:00 to 12:30 and 12:30 to 13:00.
* The campus sessions are 45-minutes sport sessions from 12:15 to 13:00.
