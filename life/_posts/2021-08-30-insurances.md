## Health insurance
Health insurance is split in two:
* “LAMal”: mandatory part. It’s a package that will be exactly the same regardless of the provider, you get to choose from some options such as the deductible amount. You can change providers every year.
* Complementary insurance: not mandatory. Typically locked-in for a period of 5 years, so be careful before signing.

As a PhD student (i.e. employed in Switzerland), the only way around the mandatory health insurance is if you come from a country that provides you health insurance unconditionally (e.g. Bulgaria), in which case you can send the state a copy of your insurance card and get exempted from having to buy a Swiss one. 

Unlike ETH PhD students, we cannot benefit from student / reduced insurance prices.

There are three variables determining the monthly premium for mandatory health insurance:
* Insurance provider: since the package is identical by law, it’s not a problem to pick the cheapest provider. It’s often Assura, but prices change every year.
* Deductible: how much you have to spend on your own in a given calendar year before the health insurance starts reimbursing further health expenses. The lower the deductible, the higher you'll have to pay to the insurance every month to compensate. If you don’t expect to have major health issues, as a young person it’s often better to pick the highest deductible.
* "Insurance model": how to access doctors and medicine. Some models require you to pick a doctor and only consult with them (“médecin de famille”), others require you to call a hotline from the insurance before getting an appointment, except in case of emergency (“callmed” / “telmed”).

A small sample of current PhD students use Assura, Helsana, Atupri and the TelMed option with the highest premiums for the cheapest insurances. You can use [comparis.ch](https://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/default?_gl=1*s27dqq*_ga*MTI0ODg4Mzk0OS4xNjMwMzQzMTA4*_ga_2VX04R3Y06*MTYzMDM0MzExMC4xLjAuMTYzMDM0MzExMC4whttps://en.comparis.ch/krankenkassen/default?_gl=1*s27dqq*_ga*MTI0ODg4Mzk0OS4xNjMwMzQzMTA4*_ga_2VX04R3Y06*MTYzMDM0MzExMC4xLjAuMTYzMDM0MzExMC4w) to find the most up-to-date prices for your health insurance situation.

## Accident
EPFL provides you with accident insurance, as is legally required of employers. You do not need to worry about this, beyond the fact that when you sign up for health insurance you should explicitly choose to not also get accident insurance otherwise you’ll be paying extra for no reason. The Student Affairs Website provides [detailed information](https://sae.epfl.ch/accident-insurance) about accident insurance. More information (in French only) can be found on the [Human Resources website](https://rh.epfl.ch/prestationsRH).

## RC (civil liability)
Elvia is cool, it’s basically Allianz but entirely online.

## ECA (fire hazards)
Insurance against fire hazard. It is mandatory in Vaud. You should automatically receive a letter from ECA after registering with your commune asking you to declare the value of the goods to insure. Typically, it is not worth under-estimating the value of your items & furniture, since the yearly cost of this insurance is really low. There is a minimum anyway below which you’ll pay the same amount, ECA will even write to you if your declared amount is way below that minimum.
