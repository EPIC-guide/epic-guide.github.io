At the school of Computer and Communication Sciences, it is common for PhD students to do internships. These internships mostly take place during summer, when you don’t have courses to take or TA. Usually, an internship is in the area of your research, but that does not need to be the case. It is recommended to discuss with your supervisor before applying / getting an internship. She/he might have concerns, or refer you to particularly interesting opportunities.

Technically, while on an internship, you will take a “leave of absence” from EPFL. You need to ask the doctoral school for approval. EPFL’s accident insurance can be prolonged up to 6 months for a fee.
