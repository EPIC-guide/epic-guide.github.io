## Semester projects

Bachelor and Master students at EPFL must complete “semester projects” in labs. They are worth a lot of credits (8 or 12), so they spend significant time on them (12 or 18 hours a week). The official naming of “semester projects” is “[research projects](https://staging-edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/research-project-in-computer-science-ii-CS-498)”.

PhD students are often tasked with coming up with project topics, and more importantly supervise the students. This typically means meeting with them once per week to check their progress, help them get unstuck, etc.

Most information can be found on the dedicated [page](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/semester-project-msc/) ([here](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/bachelor/semester-project/) for Bachelor students).

**Pro tip:** Master students are great! They can make some interesting contributions to your work. Do not assign essential parts of your research but interesting branches that you might want to explore later.

## Interns

You can also hire external Bachelor and Master's student interns to work on a related project in the summer. They will normally stay for 3 months and come from universities all over the world. It's a great way to recruit future PhD students for the lab. Labs usually have a hiring process through the [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) program -- ask senior students or your professor about your lab's process! 

## Master thesis

Master students must also complete a “Master thesis”, working full-time on a research project for one semester. They can do that either in a lab, or in industry. They are worth 30 credits. The official naming of “Master thesis” is “Master's project”.

As a supervisor, the main differences with semester projects is that the student works full-time on the project, and an external examination expert (to be found by the lab) should be part of the jury during the project oral presentation at the end of the semester.

Most information can be found in the dedicated [page](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/master-project/).

## Which computational resources should I give to my students?

PhD students in lab typically use IC-IT computational resources (HaaS or RunAI) or RCP computational ressources (also RunAI). For detailed information on these resources, please visit the relevant EPIC guide page on [IC Compute and Storage](https://epic-guide.github.io/middle/ic-compute-storage). It is possible to give access to these ressources to the students, typically by adding them in the corresponding groups (for instance, [runai-labname](https://groups.epfl.ch/#/home/S28631?opentab=members) for IC-IT RunAI or [rcp-runai-labname](https://groups.epfl.ch/#/home/S31619?opentab=members) for RCP RunAI).

Note that, in the case described above, the lab will pay for the computational resources used by the student. 
Students can however access free computational resources (including GPUs) on the EPFL-wide HPC cluster. As Bachelor/Master students, they can have 4000 CHF worth of computational resources for classes and projects. More details are given on the [dedicated page](https://www.epfl.ch/research/facilities/scitas/getting-started/accounts-on-our-facilities/#proj). After filling out the form, you will typically be contacted by SCITAS to confirm that the student is indeed doing a project under your supervision. The way to submit jobs in the HPC cluster is quite different than RunAI, and is documented in this [page](https://scitas-doc.epfl.ch/).
