## Random thoughts

* Can I just staple my papers together and call it a thesis? Depends on the lab. You probably have to write the introduction anyway. 
* I got an offer from the place I would love to work, but it’s earlier than my planned finish date, what do I do? If they gave you an offer,  you must have done something right. Talk to your supervisor, maybe you can have your defence sooner
* If you have trouble writing, take a look at “How to write a lot”. Not all that is there is relevant to science writing, but it’s quite useful. [link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1chrsg5)
