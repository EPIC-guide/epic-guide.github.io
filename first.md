## New PhD student at EPFL

You just arrived in Lausanne and you don’t know how to deal with the various administrative and practical tasks that you have to do?

* [The Doctoral School at EPFL](http://phd.epfl.ch/new-students): The EPFL Doctoral School is there to help you with your thesis. The Doctoral school also organizes welcome events for new PhD students. Their very complete website provides plenty of practical informations that are relevant when starting your PhD.
* [The Student Affairs](https://www.epfl.ch/education/studies/en/): The EPFL student affairs website gathers plenty of information for incoming PhD students. It regroups informations about for instance (but not limited to) cost of living, opening a bank account in Switzerland, or Health issues.

You may find [EDIC's arrival Guide](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-new-phd-students/) useful.


## 3 words: What's next?

Welcome to this exciting adventure! You got accepted to the program, filled all of the forms, and looked for an apartment. So what’s next?

The first year has some pretty specific regulations and rules that you need to know about, and it’s hard not to be misled by rumors and half-truths circulating in the common office and around it. Hopefully this guide will shed some light on these matters and help you to successfully accomplish your first year!

In general, if you have any doubts or questions, there are some people you can always talk to: your buddy for personal assistance, your contact person or advisor for academic questions, and the EDIC staff for administrative questions. Last but not least, you can always turn to your EPIC student’s association and/or your student representatives for help!
