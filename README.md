We try to keep the guide up to date, but if you notice any inconsistencies please tell us at [epic@groupes.epfl.ch](mailto:epic@groupes.epfl.ch), or make a pull request to this repository. For the guide to grow and stay current over time, we need **you** to contribute!

## How to contribute via pull requests

### Where to write

This site is built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
The main contents are located in one of the `_CATEGORY` directories, where `CATEGORY` is one of the following:
- `first` (Getting started)
- `middle` (Resources and responsibilities)
- `last` (Graduating)
- `life` (Life in Lausanne)

If you want to modify some contents of an existing article, locate its corresponding Markdown file by observing its permalink:
the article with permalink `https://epic-guide.github.io/CATEGORY/NAME` is located at `_CATEGORY/NAME.md`.

If you want to write a new article, add a new file in the corresponding directory.

**Note:** Please avoid changing the names of existing articles as this will change its permalink.

### Article header (YAML front matter)
In the first few lines of each article, please remember to include/update the following fields:
- `layout: post` (Just keep it like this)
- `title: "Candidacy exam"` (The full title of the article)
- `category: first` (Category as described in the previous section)
- `order: 1` (Order of the article in the category. Articles are sorted in ascending order on the guide index page.)

### How to write Markdown
The content of the articles can be written in Markdown and/or HTML.

If you are not familiar with Markdown syntax, take a look at [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

**Note:** As the `h1` heading is reserved for the article title, please use `h2` (two hashtags `##` in Markdown) or smaller headings within the article.
