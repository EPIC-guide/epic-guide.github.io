# Review of Application Materials for PhDs

## Who is this for?

**If you plan to apply to PhD programs in computer science or related
fields this year, this is for you.** You are especially encouraged to
participate if there aren't many people who can mentor you and help you craft your
   application materials. For example, if you do not know anyone who has a
   PhD in computer science, or anyone familiar with graduate
   programs/admissions at global universities, or
   you cannot get feedback from any professors or labs that you have
   already worked with.

**If you are an EPFL Master's student**:
Before contacting people below, ask members of the lab(s) you're working with for your semester project/thesis.
They will be able to give more specific feedback. Feel free to contact the people below if you cannot get feedback from your lab.

## Who is this by?

Some PhD students in the Computer & Communication Sciences department
at EPFL are volunteering to help review your application materials.

Please understand that this is a service that the PhD students are providing
in their free time, so it may take a few weeks to get a response, and we may
have to pause the program if we get too many requests. We may refuse to help
people who mass email our list of volunteers instead of choosing one or two,
or who do not take the time to first follow the guides on this website.


## Steps

1. Follow [the EPIC applying to PhD guide](/applying) for statements of purpose and resumes
2. Find _one or two_ people in the list [below](#volunteers) whose research interest match yours
3. Send them an email introducing yourself and attaching your statement of purpose and resume (we provide a template [below](#email-template))


## Volunteers

_Please pick [at random](https://www.random.org/lists/) to spread the load on our volunteers._
