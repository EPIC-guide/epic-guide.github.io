# Review of Application Materials for PhDs

**If you plan to apply to PhD programs in computer science or related fields this year, this is for you!**

You are especially encouraged to participate if there aren't many people who can mentor you
and help you craft your application materials, e.g., if you do not know anyone who has a PhD
in computer science, or anyone familiar with admissions at global universities, or if there
is no one available to give you feedback among the professors and labs you have worked with.

Some PhD students in the Computer & Communication Sciences department at EPFL are volunteering to help review your applications materials.

**If you are an EPFL student**:
Before contacting people below, ask members of the lab(s) you're working with for your semester project/thesis.
They will be able to give more specific feedback. Feel free to contact the people below if you cannot get feedback from your lab.

_Please understand that this is a service the PhD students provide in their free time, and as such answers may take a few weeks and we may have to pause it_
_if we get too many requests. We may refuse to help people who mass email our list of volunteers instead of choosing one or two,_
_or who do not take the time to first follow the guides on this website._

## Steps

1. Follow [the Applying section of the EPIC PhD guide](/applying) for statements of purpose and resumes
2. Find _one or two_ people in the list [below](#volunteers) whose research interest match yours
3. Send them an email introducing yourself and attaching your statement of purpose and resume (we provide a template [below](#email-template))


## Volunteers

_Please pick [at random](https://www.random.org/lists/) to spread the load on our volunteers._
