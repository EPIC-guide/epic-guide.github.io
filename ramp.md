## Who is this for?

**If you plan to apply to PhD programs in computer science or related fields this year, this is for you.**
You are especially encouraged to participate if there aren't many people who can mentor you and help you craft your application materials.
For example, if you do not know anyone who has a PhD in computer science, or anyone familiar with graduate programs/admissions at global universities,
or you cannot get feedback from any professors or labs that you have already worked with.

**If you are an EPFL Master's student**:
Before contacting people below, ask members of the lab(s) you're working with for your semester project/thesis.
They will be able to give the most relevant feedback. If you cannot get feedback from your lab, you are encouraged to apply for the program.


## Who is this by?

Some PhD students in the Computer & Communication Sciences department
at EPFL are volunteering to help review your application materials. This 
initiative is called EPIC RAMP, and it has entered its second cycle in 2023.

Please understand that this is a service that the PhD students are providing
in their free time, so it may take a few weeks to get a response, and we may
have to pause the program if we get too many requests. Also, 
please note that RAMP operates independently of EDIC's admission committee
and it is not considered a component of the admission process.

<!-- We may refuse to help
people who mass email our list of volunteers instead of choosing one or two,
or who do not take the time to first follow the guides on this website. -->


## Steps

1. Follow [the Applying section of the EPIC PhD guide](/applying) for statements of purpose and resumes
2. Apply for RAMP by filling the [application form](https://forms.gle/xSpr3hipj6RBCY7w8)
3. We will contact you in a few days and match you with your EPFL CS PhD mentor
4. Reach out to your mentor with any questions you have, attaching your statement of purpose and resumè so they can best assist you

<!-- 2. Find _one or two_ people in the list [below](#volunteers) whose research interest match yours
3. Send them an email introducing yourself and attaching your statement of purpose and resume (we provide a template [below](#email-template)) -->
